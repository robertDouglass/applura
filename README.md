# Introduction

If you are a new Applura user, welcome! **You've found Applura's introductory
front-end application.** It comes pre-installed on every new project. **You can
replace it at any time**, and you're not required _or expected_ to use it.

**We provide this project as a simple demonstration** of a few key features and
best-practices to know when developing a front-end application on Applura. If
ever you have a question or concern, please don't hesitate to
[open a new issue](https://github.com/Applura/intro/issues/new)!

When you're ready to build your own application, **you can start here or start
from scratch** or dive into our
[examples](https://github.com/Applura/release-examples) of more representative,
"real-world" applications for inspiration.

## Overview

This project contains a fully-functioning client and server-side rendered
front-end application. It uses React and webpack as a _lingua franca_, but
Applura can be used with your favorite tools. **You are not required to use
React or webpack** for your front-end application. The **code in this project
also contains comments** intended to introduce you to key concepts and
considerations.

Source code is bundled into **three critical files**. They are:

- `index.html`: Your application's primary HTML document. Loads your
  client-side JavaScript and other assets.
- `main.js`: The client-side version of your application. Configured via
  `webpack.config.cjs`.
- `render.js`: The server-side version of your application. Configured via
  `webpack.config.server.cjs`.

## Deployment

1. Generate an Applura deploy key.
2. [Add it as a new repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository)
   named `APPLURA_DEPLOY_KEY`.
3. Push or merge a change to the `main` branch.

## Architecture

This application uses a root component named `App`.

`App` receives a `resource` object provided by
[Applura's official JavaScript client](https://github.com/Applura/client) and
renders the appropriate page/screen of your application for that resource. Each
resource corresponds to a single URL that can be customized via the management
UI.

Notably, this application does _not_ use client-side routing to determine
layout. This is an important _feature_ of Applura applications. This decouples
your front-end code from the structure and mechanics of your application, so
you can focus entirely on presentation and interaction. Instead of using
hard-coded URL patterns to determine which components of your application to
render, every `resource` object has a `type` parameter. These correspond to
your application's resource types built in the management UI.

At a minimum, your build output directory should contain the
[three files](#overview) listed in the overview section. For asset imports,
such as a CSS link in your `index.html`, use relative URLs like
`<link href="/static/style.css" â€¦ />` instead of an absolute URL. There are no
other requirements.

> Note: All other assets in the archive will be deployed to a CDN and delivered
> via a unique URL for each deployment. You do not need to change file names in
> order to invalidate cached versions of your assets.

### Client-side specifics

The Applura JavaScript client is instantiated by importing a `bootstrap`
function in `src/index.js`. This reads dynamic data in the `<head>` of the HTML
to find the URL of the initial resource to load.

After bootstrapping the client, it is important to `start` and `stop` the
client. An example is provided in `src/components/socket.jsx`. The `Socket`
component in that file integrates the `App` component with the Applura client.

### Server-side specifics

This application will be automatically rendered by Applura's infrastructure
before it is delivered to end-users. This is enabled by including a file named
`render.js` in root of the deployment artifact uploaded in the management UI.

The `render.js` file **MUST** `export` a function named `render`. That function
**MUST** accept a `resource` object and **MUST** return a string containing the
HTML of your application's root component. The string returned by `render` will
be injected into your `index.html` file's `<div id="app">` element. It
**SHOULD** render HTML even if an error is encountered to provide a better
experience for your end-users.
